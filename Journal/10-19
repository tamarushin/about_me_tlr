Happyness:
I am feeling good about this class so far. I don't get it all yet but I know with time it will become easier.

Sadness:
My typing skills are very frustrating to me. Mitchell set me with a site that I can use for practice but I am so busy at night trying to keep up, I haven't been able to use it.
