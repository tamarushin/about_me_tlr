Happyness:
I get git!!! Well at least the ACP and pull. I really liked the fact that today's assignment taught me to really pay attention to copying someones code because it won't run if I don't type it over perfectly. Real life example.

Sadness:
I need lots of help on Functions and keeping up on the homework. I havent found a pattern yet that keeps me up to date, but I am working on that. Today is my anniversary and I forgot. (He did too so we had a great laugh!)
