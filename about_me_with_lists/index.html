      <p>Hi! I am from <i>Boulder Colorado.</i> I moved to Seattle when I was 21 years old. I worked in the photo industry for many years before I got my degree in <i><b>mechanical engineering.</i></b> I worked for Boeing as an engineer. now I am excited to shift careers and be a developer.
        I have many hobbies. My favorite hobby is making jewelry. I tend to make really chunky jewelry. I love animals with all my heart but my favorite animal is a dog. I have owned five dogs in my life. <b>Skipper, Soxy, Brittney, Cascade and Lucy.</b> I have a daughter. She is 25 and her name is <b>Shayna</b>. My favorite number is 32.</p>
